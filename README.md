## Description
Text-based version of Dice 10,000 created using Java. The player competes against the computer, in the form of four bots. The player's score is increased based on their own performance. The bots' scores are increased via a simple point distribution system. A random number is generated from 1-100, the higher the number, the greater the point range. Then another random number is generated, this time within the determined point range, rounded to a multiple of 5, and added to the bot's score. This point system intentionally has a high probability of producing lower point additions, but still has a small chance to produce higher point additions to a bot's score. The first player to accumulate over 10,000 points using the six dice wins.
